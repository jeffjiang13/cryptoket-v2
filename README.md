## Cryptoket
CryptoKet is made using the immense power of Solidity and Next.js. This project combines futuristic elements of Web3 blockchain development and the popular culture wave of non-fungible tokens (NFT).

This application includes creation, buying, selling and reselling of NFTs and user authentication through metamask wallet. Its theme can be switched to both dark and light mode.

Context API is used for state management and Tailwind CSS is used for styling the application. Solidity is used to write smart contract and hardhat is used to deploy the smart contract.



# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
